- better initial formula input
- more user affordance (highlight clickable stuff)
- interface for quantifiers
- figure out better layout css (looks bad in Chrome)
- user error handling

- Idea for dynamic updating: start off with the extra thing but at
  display:none; (width/height zero), then have it be empty but expand
  out (to allocate space) and then add in the text
